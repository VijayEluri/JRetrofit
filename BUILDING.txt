BUILDING JRETROFIT
------------------
You need Maven 2.2.1 or newer to build JRetrofit yourself. Older versions of Maven might work, but the build is not tested with them, so they are not guaranteed to work.

Once you have Maven 2.2.1 on your path, just issue the following command in the root directory of JRetrofit:

mvn clean install
