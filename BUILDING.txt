BUILDING JRETROFIT
------------------

If you want to build JRetrofit yourself, you need to take
care of the following things in your Ant installation:

1) You need apache-ant-1.7.0. Older versions will NOT work -
   their SSH support is not sufficient for "publish" target
   and its subtargets, which use <sshexec> and <scp>.
   Newer versions might work, but this is not guaranteed.
   
2) VERY IMPORTANT: You need to copy jsch-0.1.29.jar (supplied
   with JRetrofit, in directory "lib") into your
   ANT_HOME/lib directory. VERSION 0.1.29 IS THE ONLY ONE
   WHICH WORKS. Newer versions of jsch (at least 0.1.30) 
   contain a bug which cause the scp transfer in this build
   to hang. Check that you don't have any other versions
   of jsch in your ANT_HOME/lib or global CLASSPATH.
   
3) You also need to copy junit-3.8.2.jar (supplied with
   JRetrofit, in directory "lib") into your ANT_HOME/lib
   directory.
